# Sales Analytics Report in Power BI


## Project Description

In this project, I have created a dynamic and insightful sales analytics report using Power BI. The report focuses on analyzing sales performance, revenue, and profitability metrics across various dimensions. The report covers a wide range of aspects, from revenue and profit to logistics costs, and includes visualizations that help explain profitability dynamics based on different factors like customer segments, product ranges, packaging, and geographical locations. Additionally, the report employs an ABC analysis to categorize products into different classes based on their revenue contribution, aiming to optimize resource allocation.

## Project Outcome

In summary, the report is a comprehensive tool for analyzing sales performance and profitability from various angles, offering insights into customer segments, product ranges, packaging, and geographic locations. The ABC analysis further assists in resource allocation optimization by categorizing products based on their revenue contribution. This holistic approach to sales analytics can aid businesses in making informed decisions to maximize profitability and operational efficiency.
